Interface{} tree merging and copying utilities
----------------------------------------------

Put this together to work with large sets of JSON object trees, to solve the
problem of merging together of multiple JSON objects that could contain any
number of sub-objects and lists. So it recurses through the trees merging them
together. It also supports deep-copy functionality and limited lookup. See
[godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/eikenb/datatree) for more.

I don't use this for anything at present but would welcome patches.
Alternatively please feel free to copy/fork/clone whatever and do what you'd
like with it.

Note that it also supported interface{} trees generated by
[yaml](gopkg.in/yaml.v1) and [mxj](github.com/clbanning/mxj) when last I
checked. I'd want to add more tests around this though before committing to it.
